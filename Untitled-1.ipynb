    "## TBox (Ontology Structure) Analysis and Improvement Suggestions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strengths of Your Current Ontology:\n",
    "1. **Comprehensive coverage** of computational chemistry concepts\n",
    "2. **Good class hierarchy** with clear subClassOf relationships\n",
    "3. **Detailed properties** for molecular characteristics\n",
    "4. **Integration with QUDT** for units and quantities\n",
    "5. **Support for Gaussian calculations** specifically\n",
    "\n",
    "### Areas for Improvement:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Modernization Opportunities**:\n",
    "   - Adopt **CHEMINF** (Chemical Information Ontology) patterns where applicable\n",
    "   - Incorporate **BFO** (Basic Formal Ontology) upper-level categories\n",
    "   - Align with **SSNO** (Semantic Sensor Network Ontology) for computation as process\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Class Structure Improvements**:\n",
    "   - Consider separating **computational process** from **results** more clearly\n",
    "   - Add more specific subclasses for different **quantum chemistry methods** (DFT, HF, MP2, etc.)\n",
    "   - Distinguish between **single-point calculations** and **geometry optimizations** more explicitly\n",
    "   - Add classes for **transition states** and **reaction pathways**\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Property Enhancements**:\n",
    "   - Add inverse properties for better navigation (e.g., `isCalculationOf` inverse of `isCalculationOn`)\n",
    "   - Include more **metadata properties** (software parameters, convergence criteria)\n",
    "   - Add **validation properties** (energy convergence, normal mode checks)\n",
    "   - Include **provenance information** (who ran the calculation, when)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Unit and Quantity Improvements**:\n",
    "   - More comprehensive integration with **QUDT**\n",
    "   - Add support for **uncertainty values** in results\n",
    "   - Include **conversion factors** between common units\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Specific Suggested Additions**:\n",
    "   - Classes for **solvation models** (PCM, COSMO, etc.)\n",
    "   - Properties for **electronic structure** (orbitals, densities)\n",
    "   - Support for **periodic systems** and **surface calculations**\n",
    "   - **Machine learning potential** concepts\n",
    "   - **High-throughput computation** workflow support\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example SPARQL Query to Identify Gaps:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sparql\n",
    "# Find classes with very few or no instances\n",
    "SELECT ?class (COUNT(?instance) AS ?instanceCount)\n",
    "WHERE {\n",

    "  }\n",
    "}\n",
    "GROUP BY ?class\n",
    "ORDER BY ASC(?instanceCount)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Suggested New SPARQL Queries for Ontology Development:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Find properties with limited usage**:\n",
    "```sparql\n",
    "SELECT ?property (COUNT(?s) AS ?usageCount)\n",
    "WHERE {\n",
    "  ?s ?property ?o .\n",
    "  FILTER(STRSTARTS(STR(?property), \"http://purl.org/gc/\"))\n",
    "}\n",
    "GROUP BY ?property\n",
    "ORDER BY ASC(?usageCount)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Identify potential missing inverse properties**:\n",
    "```sparql\n",
    "SELECT ?property \n",
    "WHERE {\n",
    "  ?property a owl:ObjectProperty .\n",
    "  FILTER NOT EXISTS { ?property owl:inverseOf ?inverse }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Check for classes that might need subclasses**:\n",
    "```sparql\n",
    "SELECT ?class (COUNT(?subclass) AS ?subclassCount)\n",
    "WHERE {\n",
    "  ?class a owl:Class .\n",
    "  OPTIONAL { ?subclass rdfs:subClassOf ?class }\n",
    "}\n",
    "GROUP BY ?class\n",
    "ORDER BY DESC(?subclassCount)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation Strategy:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **First analyze your instance data** with the provided queries to understand usage patterns\n",
    "2. **Identify which areas** of your ontology are most heavily used\n",
    "3. **Prioritize improvements** based on actual usage and research needs\n",
    "4. **Consider versioning** your ontology as you make changes\n",
    "5. **Document changes carefully** to maintain backward compatibility\n",
    "\n",
    "Would you like me to elaborate on any particular aspect of these suggestions or provide more specific SPARQL queries for your investigation?"

    "## 2. TBox Critique & Suggestions for Improvement\n",
    "\n",
    "Your ontology shows a great deal of effort in covering many aspects of computational chemistry. Still, as ontologies evolve, there are always opportunities to refine and modernize the model. Here are some points to consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "### a. **Inconsistent or Redundant Class Definitions**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Observation:**  \n",
    "  Some classes (e.g., `GaussianCalculation`, `G16`, `G09`) are defined in multiple ways or as both a class and (implicitly) as a type of instance. This can make reasoning ambiguous.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Suggestion:**  \n",
    "  Clearly separate **TBox** (schema-level classes, properties, axioms) from **ABox** (actual instances). For example, treat specific software packages or calculation types as individuals or as instances of a clearly defined class like `SoftwarePackage` rather than subclassing from a calculation class.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### b. **Domain and Range Issues**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Observation:**  \n",
    "  Several properties do not have complete domain or range declarations or include multiple conflicting ranges. This weakens automatic data validation and reasoning.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Suggestion:**  \n",
    "  Audit your properties to ensure that every property has a single, clear domain and range. If a property is intended to relate entities of multiple types, consider splitting it or using union classes (with clear documentation).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### c. **Excessive Namespace Usage and Duplication**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Observation:**  \n",
    "  Your ontology imports and uses many namespaces (e.g., QUDT, DC, SPIN, SHACL, PeriodicTable). While this can be very powerful, it also introduces redundancy and potential conflicts (for example, mixing deprecated vocabularies like SPIN with SHACL).\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Suggestion:**  \n",
    "  - **Consolidate:** Evaluate if all the imported vocabularies are necessary. Where possible, consolidate overlapping concepts.  \n",
    "  - **Modernize:** Consider replacing older vocabularies (like SPIN) with more current standards (e.g., SHACL for data validation).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### d. **Missing Logical Axioms and Constraints**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Observation:**  \n",
    "  Many classes lack restrictions (e.g., owl:Restriction or equivalentClass axioms) that could help enforce domain rules or enable automated classification.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Suggestion:**  \n",
    "  - **Add Restrictions:** For example, you might specify that every `GaussianCalculation` must have exactly one `hasRunDate` or that a `MolecularComputation` must have an associated methodology feature.\n",
    "  - **Disjointness Axioms:** Where appropriate, define disjoint classes to prevent unintended class overlaps.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### e. **Metadata and Documentation**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Observation:**  \n",
    "  The ontology contains a number of comments and labels, but metadata (such as creator information, versioning, or a clear description of the ontology’s scope) could be enhanced.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Suggestion:**  \n",
    "  Enrich the `<owl:Ontology>` block with detailed metadata using Dublin Core or similar standards. Include version numbers, authorship, change history, and a clear statement of intended use.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### f. **Naming Conventions and Modularity**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Observation:**  \n",
    "  There are inconsistencies in naming conventions (for instance, some properties and classes use mixed cases or hyphenation) and definitions that could be better modularized.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Suggestion:**  \n",
    "  - **Standardize Naming:** Choose a consistent naming convention (e.g., CamelCase or snake_case) for classes and properties.  \n",
    "  - **Modularize:** Consider breaking the ontology into smaller, modular ontologies (e.g., one module for unit handling, one for computational methods, one for system properties) that can be maintained and updated independently.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Run the Queries:** Use the provided SPARQL queries in your Blazegraph Workbench to get a quantitative overview of your instance data.  \n",
    "- **Audit the Data:** Check for orphaned nodes and examine the usage counts of key properties.  \n",
    "- **Plan Revisions:** Based on the instance audit, decide whether certain classes or properties are underused or misapplied.  \n",
